# REMD


## Automated Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics protocol

##                               Principle

The script is an automated Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics protocol.



##                               Install and execute
To install with docker:
```
docker build -t remd:remd_engine .
```
To use only the python scripts, first install all the requiered module:
```
argparse
subprocess
sys
re
time
os
Bio.PDB
glob
subprocess
shutil
math
mdtraj
pyemma
```
By default, the user can provide a sequence file, the script will create a reference structure (PDB file)
and a topology file. 
To lunch the REMD users must provide also temperature reference (for each replic).
Then a minimization, equilibration and md production with gromacs with the force field Amber 96 are made
```
 main.py -seq seq.txt -temperature "300 318 337.97 358.81 380.85 404.27 429.12 455.50"
 
```
 Arguments bellow are optional
```
 -g: reference PDB used to create topology file (default None)
 -p: topology file (default None)
 -cyclic: flag for cyclic peptide (default False)
 -temperature: temperature reference (default None)
 -time: time simulation in ps (default 200000) 
 -o: output path filenamec (default current folder)
 -seq: file with amino acid sequence
 -log: Log file's name (file.log)
```

##                              Example
You can execute the script to create a PDB and topology files:
By providing a text file countaining amino acid sequences (code 1 letter). 
For cysteins that form disulfide bridge, use letter X instead C.
```
python main.py -seq seq.txt
```
If you want to create a cyclic peptide you have to use the flag -cyclic
```
python main.py -seq seq.txt -cyclic True
```
To lunch REMD you must provide temperature for replica:
```
python main.py -seq seq.txt -temperature "300 318 337.97 358.81 380.85 404.27 429.12 455.50"
```
It is possible to use an other force field by providing a PDB and topology files:
```
python main.py -seq seq.txt -temperature "300 318 337.97 358.81 380.85 404.27 429.12 455.50" -g ref.pdb -p topology.top
```
##                               Output

2 files:
* Log file (arguments used and other info)
* PDB file contain the structures

#                               Warning

The script use tleap (amberTools 18), acpype, GROMACS 5.1.2 and scwrl 3.0. If you don't use Docker, be sure the softwares are installed and modify path in the python scripts.

##                              UPCOMING FEATURES

* PEP 8
* Ramachadran plot for each residues
